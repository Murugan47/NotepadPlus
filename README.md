# Notepad Android App

A simple lightweight notepad for Android with widget support.

## Current Features

- Supports **one note** that stores all the information displayed on the widget.
- **Active saving**: edits or exiting the app automatically updates the widget — no reload required.
- **Read-only widget**: the widget is only used to display the note; it cannot be edited directly.

## Future Additions

- Basic text editing: choose different fonts, adjust font size, alignment, etc.
- Multiple notes support: store more than one note and select which one is displayed on the widget.
- Lightweight updates: improvements will focus on keeping the app and updates as small and efficient as possible.
