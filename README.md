# Notepad Android App

A simple lightweight notepad for Android designed for the widget aspect alone. A simple homescreen widget that displays what is typed on the notepad itself.

## Current Features

- Currently supports **a singular note** that stores all the information displayed on the widget.
- **Active saving**: edits or exiting the app automatically updates the widget — no reload required.
- **Read-only widget**: the widget is only used to display the note; it cannot be edited directly, it also does not allow clicking on the note and accidently getting misdirected to the app itself.

## Future Additions

- Basic text editing: choose different fonts, adjust font size, alignment, etc.
- Multiple notes support: store more than one note and select which one is displayed on the widget.
- Lightweight updates: improvements will focus on keeping the app and updates as small and efficient as possible.
